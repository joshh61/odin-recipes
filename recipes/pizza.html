    <h1>Steps for Recipe</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Set the oven rack to the lower position. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees</li>
        <li>Allow the prepared pizza dough to sit out at room temperature for 30
            minutes. This step is only required if you're working with a refrigerated dough.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings: fry the bacon, cook the sausage, shred the cheese using a
            GoodCook Grater, and measure out the rest.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the Dough - On a lightly floured surface, stretch and shape the dough
            into a 10-inch circle - transfer to the baking sheet. Use fingers to press into a 12-inch 
            circle. Leave the edges slightly thicker, about 1/2-inch tall and wide.
        </li>
        <li>Brush olive oil on the edges to make the crust crispier when baked.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, followed by the mozzarella cheese,
            parmasean cheese, pepperoni, bacon, canadian bacon, and sausage.
            Sprinke on italian seasoning and red pepper flakes (if desired).
        </li>
        <li>Cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10
            to 13 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Immediately slice and serve while still hot.</li>
    </ol>
